## Showcase

The showcase example will list all of the components that can be built using [`vedas-ui`](../../vedas-ui/README.md).

The __[`main`]__ file contains all the code of the example.

You can run it with `trunk serve`, but wait you need to install some dependencies first:
```
npm i
```
Then, build:
```
trunk build
```
Here we go, just run it in browser.

[`main`]: src/main.rs
